1. Collect and preprocess the data:
    Gather the dataset you want to use for building the linear regression model.
    Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and fixing inconsistencies.
    Encode categorical variables, if present, using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
    Split the dataset into training and testing sets (commonly using a 70-30, 80-20, or 75-25 ratio) to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

2.Train the linear regression model:
    Choose a linear regression implementation (e.g., using scikit-learn in Python).
    Train the model on the training dataset by fitting it to the independent (input) and dependent (output) variables.

3.Make predictions:
    Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing dataset (or validation dataset, if you have one).

4.Evaluate the model's performance:
    Compare the model's predictions to the actual (observed) values in the testing dataset using performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.
    Create residual plots to visually assess the model's assumptions and diagnose potential issues.

5.Fine-tune the model (optional):
    If the model's performance is not satisfactory, you can try adjusting the features used in the model, applying data transformations, or using a different type of regression model (e.g., ridge regression, LASSO, or polynomial regression).
    Retrain the model and evaluate its performance again.

6.Deploy the model:
    Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it in your application or system for making predictions on new, unseen data.
    This might involve integrating the model into a web service, embedding it within a software application, or deploying it on a cloud-based platform.
